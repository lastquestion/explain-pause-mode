;;; Commentary:

;; `explain-pause-mode' is a minor mode that measures and explains when Emacs has
;; paused doing work for a long time.  Any user input during a pause is not processed
;; until it is complete.  So in other words, `explain-pause-mode' tries to explain
;; sources of user latency.  When many pauses of the same kind occur, it also
;; generates profiling reports that can be investigated immediately or sent to
;; developers.

;; Please see README.md for commentary, documentation, etc. in the repository
;; above.

  "Toggle whether to attempt to discover and explain pauses in emacs.

When enabled, explain-pause will attempt to time how long blocking activity
takes. If it measures blocking work that takes longer then a configurable
amount of time, explain-pause logs contextual information that can be used
to help diagnose and propose areas of elisp that might affect emacs
interactivity.

When blocking work takes too long many times, explain-mode profiles the
blocking work using the builtin Emacs profiler (`profiler' package). A fixed
number of these are saved.

This mode hooks the command cycle, both idle and regular timers, and process
filters and sentinels."
